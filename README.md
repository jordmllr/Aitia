## Project Philosophy
This project is a technology transfer project. It looks forward to a post-scarcity world and seeks to design products which can be made to improve people's lives in a meaningful way without waste and without attempting to squeeze as much profit out of them as possible. We are not anti-capitalist or pro-capitalist.
